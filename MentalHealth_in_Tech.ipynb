    "**Business Context.** \n",
    "There are two questions that we might be able to aswer:\n",
    " A. How is the productivity affected by the work environment for people with mental health problems ?\n",
    " B. How likely is for a person to develop a mental health within specific work environment ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question A\n",
    "To answer question A, we would need to look at:\n",
    "\"Do you believe your productivity is ever affected by a mental health issue?\"  based on work conditions.\n",
    "However, this question is not answered by any of the employees from US. \n",
    "Instead, we could look at :\n",
    " - If you have a mental health disorder, how often do you feel that it interferes with your work *when being treated effectively?*\n",
    " - If you have a mental health disorder, how often do you feel that it interferes with your work *when* _*NOT*_* being treated effectively (i.e., when you are experiencing symptoms)?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe we can relate this to how well people with/without treatment are doing at work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we could rephrase the question A as following: **How likely is that an employee with a mental disease would look for treatment ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Examples:\n",
    "- company support\n",
    "- environment at work (superviser, co-workers)\n",
    "- insurance coverage\n",
    "- medical leave\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question B\n",
    "Select people with MD, which had no family history of MD:\n",
    "with previous MD (check if worked in a tech company): 7\n",
    "without previous MD : 3\n",
    "We might be lacking in statistics here. We would need to check if we gain more from adding the 2018,2016 and 2014 datasets, or adding the rest of the countries (not very happy with this one).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The dataset consists of OSMI 2019-2014 survey results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case Studied.** The following cases need to be completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the features representative for the study and change the feature names for simplifying the data manipulation.\n",
    "2. Map the categorical and boolean variables to numerical values.\n",
    "3. Manipulate the missing (NaN) values\n",
    "4. Build the data table necessary for question A\n",
    "5. Build the data table necessary for question B"
