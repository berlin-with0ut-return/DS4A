# DS4A
A project examining mental health in the tech industry

## Introduction

**Business Context.** 
The primary question investigated was:

  How is productivity affected by the work environment for people with mental health disorders (MHDs)?
 
**Business Problem.** 

##### The Question
To answer the question, we would need to look at if workers believe their productivity was affected by a mental health issue, based on work conditions.
Instead, we could look at :
 - If you have a mental health disorder, how often do you feel that it interferes with your work *when being treated effectively?*
 - If you have a mental health disorder, how often do you feel that it interferes with your work *when* _*NOT*_* being treated effectively (i.e., when you are experiencing symptoms)?*

This relates to how well people with/without treatment are doing at work. 

Now, we could rephrase the question A as following: **How likely is that an employee with a mental disease would look for treatment?**

Feature Examples:
- company support
- environment at work (superviser, co-workers)
- insurance coverage
- medical leave

**Analytical Context.** The dataset consists of OSMI 2019-2014 survey results.
